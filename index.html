        <h1>A Snapshot of Commercial Globalization</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Engine of Modern Trade Globalization üöÄ</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Global trade has consistently <strong>grown faster than the world's GDP</strong>[cite: 39]. [cite_start]This acceleration is a result of <strong>trade liberalization</strong>, a process of reducing protectionist barriers that began with the GATT agreement in 1947[cite: 23].</p>
            <h3>What are Protectionist Barriers?</h3>
            <p>These are policies designed to make imported goods less attractive than domestic ones.</p>
            <ul>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Customs Tariffs:</strong> A tax on imported goods[cite: 29]. For example, placing a 10% tariff on imported cars makes locally-produced cars cheaper in comparison.</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Import Quotas:</strong> A physical limit on how much can be imported[cite: 26]. For instance, a country might only allow 10,000 tons of foreign sugar to be imported per year.</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Administrative & Technical Barriers:</strong> Complex rules that are difficult for foreign products to meet, such as specific food safety regulations or complicated customs paperwork[cite: 32].</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Evolving Landscape of Global Trade üìä</h2>
            <h3>What We Trade:</h3>
            <ul>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Manufactured Goods:</strong> These are the most dynamic products, representing the largest share of global trade[cite: 52]. Think of products like cars, electronics, and machinery.</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Services:</strong> Trade in services like international tourism, finance, and transportation is a rapidly growing sector[cite: 54, 57].</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who Trades:</h3>
            <ul>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>A Geographic Shift:</strong> While historically concentrated in developed countries, trade is seeing a rapid increase in the share of <strong>developing countries</strong>, especially emerging economies in Asia like China and the Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs)[cite: 73, 76].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Developed nations tend to specialize in manufactured goods [cite: 82][cite_start], while many developing countries have historically focused on primary goods (like minerals and agricultural products)[cite: 86].</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rule-Maker: The World Trade Organization (WTO) üèõÔ∏è</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Established in 1995 as the successor to GATT[cite: 107], the WTO is the central organization governing international trade rules.</p>
            <ul>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Main Goal:</strong> The liberalization of international trade[cite: 106].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Membership:</strong> It has <strong>164 member countries</strong>, which account for 98% of all global trade[cite: 117].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Core Functions:</strong> Administering trade agreements, providing a forum for trade negotiations, and settling trade disputes between members[cite: 109, 111, 115].</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rise of Trading Blocs: Economic Integration ü§ù</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Economic integration occurs when countries remove trade barriers among themselves to boost commerce[cite: 211]. [cite_start]This has led to a massive proliferation of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), with <strong>287 agreements in force</strong> as of 2018[cite: 219].</p>
            
            <h3>Schema: Levels of Economic Integration</h3>
            <div class="schema">
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Level 1: Free Trade Area (FTA)</strong><br><em>No tariffs between members.</em> [cite: 259]</p>
                <p><strong>+</strong></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Level 2: Customs Union</strong><br><em>Common external tariff for non-members.</em> [cite: 261]</p>
                <p><strong>+</strong></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Level 3: Common Market</strong><br><em>Free movement of labor and capital.</em> [cite: 263]</p>
                <p><strong>+</strong></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Level 4: Economic Union</strong><br><em>Coordinated economic policies.</em> [cite: 265]</p>
                <p><strong>+</strong></p>
                [cite_start]<p><strong>Level 5: Political Union</strong><br><em>Shared political institutions.</em> [cite: 266]</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Examples of Integration Levels:</h3>
            <ol>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Free Trade Area (FTA):</strong> A real-world example is the agreement between the <strong>United States, Mexico, and Canada (NAFTA/USMCA)</strong>[cite: 297].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Customs Union:</strong> <strong>Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia)</strong> is an example, though it has some imperfections[cite: 301].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Common Market:</strong> A customs union that also allows for the free movement of services and factors of production[cite: 263].</li>
                [cite_start]<li><strong>Economic Union:</strong> A common market with highly coordinated economic policies[cite: 265].</li>
                <li><strong>Political Union:</strong> The deepest level, involving a single overarching policy. [cite_start]The <strong>European Union</strong> is the most advanced example[cite: 294]. [cite_start]Its <strong>Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)</strong>, where only some members use the Euro, shows that this integration can happen in stages[cite: 267].</li>
